There're gonna be 2 hours left to my course selection appointment because I memorized the appointment time wrong (lol). Now I have some time to write this post.</p><p>I got the available courses of Fall 2023 during the spring break, but I hesitated. Shall I add back Psychology major? Shall I choose math courses? Shall I try some new stuff? Or, am I that interested in data analysis, or am I lying to myself?</p><p>I feel like I was pushed by life, and credits I earned became a burden. My classmates gasped that I might could graduate earlier, in 2.5 to 3 years, getting to work earlier, which they expected. But when I looked at the the Spotify intern page (I'm not depreciating this company) and found students in the video mentioned how they were introduced company culture, I felt conflict. Are companies shaping my point of view and persuading me into their screws, even if I didn't have a similar goal with the companies? I could not accept spending my whole life in a place I possibly got no passion (but regarding the company's passion as passion) without knowing my real interest.</p><p>And I didn't found myself as curious with brain as other medical students in psychology class.</p><p>Also, when I looked at the CS homework from Tsing Hwa University at GitHub, I doubted the way of how I made CS projects. My CS knowledge is like fragments. Though I might solve problems with more advanced skills such as linked lists, I have no idea with designing a project myself, even without a rough picture.<p>Here's something I wanna mention: I played SHENZHEN I/O during Spring Break. There was one task that impressed me: connecting audio input, maximize, and output. Though the game was about hardware and assembly language, it hinted me to think of how shall the product work, what was the purpose of connecting certain components, and the most important thing -- a rough idea of the product, or why I need this product.</p><p>So for the next semester, I wanna stop programming in class for a while, but explore something new.</p><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2023-03-22</p></div><a href=#top><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style=font-size:30px;color:#000></i></a></main><footer class=footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/center-img.js></script><ul class=footer-links><li><a href=/en/posts/index.xml type=application/rss+xml title="RSS feed">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ target=_blank>License
