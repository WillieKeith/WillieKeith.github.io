The symbol of partial differentiaion is a bit confused to me at first, but there&amp;rsquo;s an easier way of thinking about differentiaion in 3-dimentional cases: cutting cakes.
When you plan to cut a cake, you can either cut it in two ways: you can cut it from left to right, or from front to back.</description></item><item><title>Complex Numbers &amp; Polar Coordinates</title><link>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/01/24/complex-numbers-polar-coordinates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 13:47:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/01/24/complex-numbers-polar-coordinates/</guid><description>This is a complex number: $$z = x + iy$$ A complex number, as a combination of a real number ($x$) and an imagenary number ($iy$, or $yi$, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter) can be sketched with 2-dimentional axis. Note that $y$ is a real number, and $i$ is an imagenary number ($i = \sqrt{-1}$).
This is an example from mathbits :
The real axis represents the real number $x$, with each unit representing 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
