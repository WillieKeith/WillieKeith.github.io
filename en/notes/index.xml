ROS??? Tell me more about it. To design and run a robot, one easy way is to use ROS.
Why we use ROS? A lazy way to compile :P Otherwise you may need pointers and need to handle a bunch of annoying bugs. System requirement? Linux. I use ubuntu 20.04.6. And if you are using windows 10 or 11, you can conside windows subsystem, which is the easiest way.</description></item><item><title>Cholera Death Map</title><link>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/05/08/cholera-death-map/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 02:32:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/05/08/cholera-death-map/</guid><description>Note: this is the final assignment of Intro GIS class (ENST 200) at Illinois Wesleyan University, Spring 2024. The map was made in ArcMap (though it is going to retire after summer).
Figure 1: the map of cholera death prediction using spatial interpolation. It contains the information of water pumps, actual death (marked in circle) in each observation points. Observation points without death are not marked on the map, but they are used for IDW calculation.</description></item><item><title>Complex Numbers &amp; Polar Coordinates</title><link>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/01/24/complex-numbers-polar-coordinates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 13:47:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/01/24/complex-numbers-polar-coordinates/</guid><description>This is a complex number: $$z = x + iy$$ A complex number, as a combination of a real number ($x$) and an imagenary number ($iy$, or $yi$, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter) can be sketched with 2-dimentional axis. Note that $y$ is a real number, and $i$ is an imagenary number ($i = \sqrt{-1}$).
This is an example from mathbits :
The real axis represents the real number $x$, with each unit representing 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
