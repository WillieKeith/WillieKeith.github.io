In linux terminal, at your home directory, create a folder as your workspace directory using mkdir [your folder name], for instance, mkdir test_ws. Use cd [your new folder name], for instance, cd test_ws, to navigaite into your directory. Then run mkdir src to create your source folder. (Tip: You can use ls to check what&amp;rsquo;s inside your folder or directory.</description></item><item><title>Cholera Death Map</title><link>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/05/08/cholera-death-map/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 02:32:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/05/08/cholera-death-map/</guid><description>Note: this is the final assignment of Intro GIS class (ENST 200) at Illinois Wesleyan University, Spring 2024. The map was made in ArcMap (though it is going to retire after summer).
Figure 1: the map of cholera death prediction using spatial interpolation. It contains the information of water pumps, actual death (marked in circle) in each observation points. Observation points without death are not marked on the map, but they are used for IDW calculation.</description></item><item><title>Initial Thoughts of Partial Differentiation</title><link>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/02/29/initial-thoughts-of-partial-differentiation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:15:04 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/02/29/initial-thoughts-of-partial-differentiation/</guid><description>As a person who&amp;rsquo;ve only completed Calc 1 &amp;amp; 2, I just started learning some partial differentiation. The symbol of partial differentiaion is a bit confused to me at first, but there&amp;rsquo;s an easier way of thinking about differentiaion in 3-dimentional cases: cutting cakes.
When you plan to cut a cake, you can either cut it in two ways: you can cut it from left to right, or from front to back.</description></item><item><title>Complex Numbers &amp; Polar Coordinates</title><link>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/01/24/complex-numbers-polar-coordinates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 13:47:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://weifanz.github.io/en/2024/01/24/complex-numbers-polar-coordinates/</guid><description>This is a complex number: $$z = x + iy$$ A complex number, as a combination of a real number ($x$) and an imagenary number ($iy$, or $yi$, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter) can be sketched with 2-dimentional axis. Note that $y$ is a real number, and $i$ is an imagenary number ($i = \sqrt{-1}$).
This is an example from mathbits :
The real axis represents the real number $x$, with each unit representing 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
