### About Me
<p>Hi, my name is Weifan Zhou (pronounced as way-fa:n Jhoh). My another name is Flora, and you can use both names to call me. I am a sophmore in Illinois Wesleyan University, a liberal art college in the United States.</p>

### Hobbies
- Piano: I am learning piano in Illinois Wesleyan University as a non-major student, and I am a piano accompanist.
- Gamesï¼šMy favorite is <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. I also love <em>FTL: Faster then Light</em>, <em>Anno 1800</em>, and <em>SHENZHEN I/O</em>.
- Astrology: I know a little bit about horoscope, but never ask me to predict your future because even I CANNOT predict my future... I prefer regarding astrology as a life warning or personality analysis for myself.
- Pesonality Analysis: I am learning MBTI, Ennegram, and Instinctual Variant (that's why I am still searching k-pop idol videos even if I am not a fan).

### About this Website
- There are English & Chinese posts with independent contents. If you have translators and want to read more stuff, you can consider also read Chinese posts (though I assume the translators can be terrible sometimes).
- Thanks to <a href = "https://hongtaoh.com/" target = "_blank">Hongtao Hao</a> providing instructions of building a website.

### Others
- Started from November 2023, I am a member of Sigma Alpha Iota (but technically it's a music fraternity instead of sorority).
