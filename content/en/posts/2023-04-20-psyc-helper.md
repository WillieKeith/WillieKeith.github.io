<p>Reminder for those catching ddl in psyc paper:</p>

<p>If you are out of time, here are 2 options.</p>

1. choose a easy but shallow topic. You may find summarizing articles easy but struggling reaching page requirements. Choose this pathway if you are not interested in psychology or you want to finish project as soon as possible.  
2. choose a topic related to recent research or from an interdiciplinary research. The theme is great and fun, and you love your research topic, but the first few articles you look at (especially those containing lots of ERP scans) can be extremely difficult to understand. But for your long term research plans, they worth reading.

<p>For behaviral neuroscience, if you have no idea of which papers you should choose, divide them into 3 perspectives:</p>

1. Background: why the newest research was conducted
2. Brain functions & places: usually are experiments which introduce which part of the brain support which function    
3. Lesion: Case studies which also support the brain function. (Case studies are easier to read than long experiments.)    
- <sup>Above is my way of reaching pages. Hope they are helpful for organizing papers.</sup>

<p>For reading papers, you may notice most papers are devided into those parts:</p>

1. Background: previous research
2. Equippments: Is the equippment for brain structure or brain activity?
3. Experiments
4. Conclusion
