I did not fully understand "Class" until this weekend I used code cademy and learned about structure. I was confused whether Class is like std or a type like int (I was thinking how types are defined). Now I know it's a datatype. And I realized why private and public are needed. Probably, for safety reasons, the developer doesn't wanna users to revise data, such as deposits, to be a billionaire (lol).
