<p>I found the email verification system of Pearson wiered. It allows a new account to complete sign-up process BEFORE email verificaion, whereas on other websites, the account cannot be created or used until the user finishes email verification.</p>
<p>Here is the problem: If I mistakenlly type the adress wrong twice, not just a typo but by entering a wrong domain name (for example, if I input ".com" instead of ".edu") and I never realize this error, I would never be able to complete email verification. Typing the email address twice might not prevent such an issue.</p>
