<p>Today is the academic advising day. There're gonna be 2 hours left to my course selection appointment because I memorized the appointment time wrong (lol). Now I have some time to write this post.</p>
<p>I got the available courses of Fall 2023 during the spring break, but I hesitated. Shall I add back Psychology major? Shall I choose math courses? Shall I try some new stuff? Or, am I that interested in data analysis, or am I lying to myself?</p>
<p>I feel like I was pushed by life, and credits I earned became a burden. My classmates gasped that I might could graduate earlier, in 2.5 to 3 years, getting to work earlier, which they expected. But when I looked at the the Spotify intern page (I'm not depreciating this company) and found students in the video mentioned how they were introduced company culture, I felt conflict. Are companies shaping my point of view and persuading me into their screws, even if I didn't have a similar goal with the companies? I could not accept spending my whole life in a place I possibly got no passion (but regarding the company's passion as passion) without knowing my real interest.</p>
<p>And I didn't found myself as curious with brain as other medical students in psychology class.</p>
<p>Also, when I looked at the CS homework from Tsing Hwa University at GitHub, I doubted the way of how I made CS projects. My CS knowledge is like fragments. Though I might solve problems with more advanced skills such as linked lists, I have no idea with designing a project myself, even without a broad picture.
<p>So I wanna stop for a while about programming in academic point of view.</p>
