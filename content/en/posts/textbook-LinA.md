<p>If you are a computer science student, or other non-math majors, I recommend “Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code”, written by Mike X Cohen, as ONE OF your textbooks. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<p>1. This textbook doesn't begin with Gauss elimination or linear equations; instead, it talks about vectors first. In my opinion, the book is more geometrically based. If you have some background knowledge of vectors from high school (for example, if you're from Mainland China), this textbook will help you connect your high school knowledge more effectively.</p>
<p>2. This book does NOT simply list definitions. For non-math-major students, understanding concepts solely through definitions can be challenging. The author of the textbook explains definitions in a non-mathematical manner, using conversational language. He also provides a lot of clarification between different difitions, paticularly when students tend to confuse certain concepts. Additionally, if English is not your first language, this book might be a good choice :P.</p>
<p>3. This textbook includes Python and Matlab code, allowing you to visualize vectors. If your major is computer science or neuroscience, I highly recommend this book.</p>
<p>However, I also suggest having another textbook recommended by your professors to review definitions, as this book takes more of an illustrative approach rather than following a traditional textbook format. Nevertheless, if you find yourself confused with definitions in class, I recommend referring to Cohen's book while studying your traditional textbooks.</p>
