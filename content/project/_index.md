### Robotics Summer Research @UofL LARRI
I am working on OctoCan, an ituitive, reliable, and safe physical human-robot interaction system. It's a robot arm with tactile sensors. There are three things I am working on:
- CAD Design: mount (which can hold a pen for subject testing) & a support between the BoxCan (the framework beside pathes) and the see-through cap.
- Sensor Testing (almost done)
- Migrating old project to new OctoCan model (in-progress)
- Subject testing of the old OctoCan (possibly)

### Course Project: Applied Data Analysis

Those are projects of CS377. Obviously, there are some flaws, such as inappropriate method for time series data and geospatial data, but they are my first individual try of machine learnng (which I did not realize until project ends).You can check the code here. 
- [Code](https://github.com/weifanz/CS-377-Applied-Data-Analysis-Course-Projects) for 3 projects

### Group Project: To Do List

A simple todo list web app (though it did not use database) finished by 4 bachelor students.This is a course project on Fall 2023 from Software Dev course.
