On Snapchat, there is a map which you can see what people were doing in the past 24 hours. Though in some countries like China and Post Soviet Countries, people are not used to use Snapchat, in big cities there are still quite a lot users posting stories. Around EST 1:00 AM, August 21st, even in Pyongyang, there was a user (not a North Korean), though I am not sure if that person's location was true.

One of the most shocking truth is that there was no single post from Ukraine at EST 1:00 AM, August 21st, even not from big cities. So there are a few assumptions: first, the internet and other infrustructions were almost destroyed in the whole Ukraine; and second, since Ukraine was not a country people typically use Snapchat (instead Telegram), most elites had escaped.

Another shocking thing was in Gaza area, Palestine, there were still quite a lot users posting in Gaza City and near areas. I can see the ruin of the buildings in some posts, but on the other hand, Gaza's internet and infrustructures are not destroyed. And thus, the conflict between Gaza and Iserael was not even a war, but a conflict.
